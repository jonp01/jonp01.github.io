  <p style="font-size:20px"> Secure Message Delivery (SMD) is a hackathon project for the TAMUHack 2021 made by Khaza Chowdhury, James Shepherd, Jonathan Peng, and Kobi Shurtz.
  <br><br>
  The program is designed to be a timed message posting service. The user is able to post a message and specify a time when they would like that message posted. The message is then posted at the specified time with a time stamp. 
  <br><br>
  The initial idea came from wanting a way to say "I told you so" and prove it. 
  <br><br>
  We are an extremely ametuer group of programmers with only basic level knowdledge in Java and Python, two languages we did not use for this project. We wanted to build a website so we had to learn how to use HTML and PHP. This was a very grueling and difficult task to do in a weekend but we enjoyed learning the new languages and are proud of what we were able to accomplish even though it is not much.
